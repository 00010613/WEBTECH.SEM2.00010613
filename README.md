# **.blog Web application**

The ".blog" is pretty, user-friendly and a very simple blog posting application on various topics. ".blog" was created to fulfill Web Technology module's requirements and does not represent an actual company or service

### About ".blog" application:

The main functionality of the web application is to create/delete and read various posts from the database in the JSON format. To create the application functionality, the NODE.JS platform was used, for the front parts - Sass and Pug packages.

### Some experience faced in the process of creation:

The process of creating the application was quite interesting. It is worth noting that due to the complicated design of the front part, it was a bit difficult to typeset the pesponsiveness of the web app, but the task was successfully completed. The materials studied in the seminars were sufficient to produce the functionality of this application. The creation of this application gave me a lot of experience and new knowledge, which I hope in the future will definitely come in handy in my career ladder.
