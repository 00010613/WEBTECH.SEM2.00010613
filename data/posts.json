		"post_content": "t’s been a year like no other, and we aren’t talking about the pandemic. There were rapid-fire public offerings, surging cryptocurrencies and skyrocketing stock prices. The number of billionaires on Forbes’ 35th annual list of the world’s wealthiest exploded to an unprecedented 2,755—660 more than a year ago. Altogether they are worth $13.1 trillion, up from $8 trillion on the 2020 list. \r\n\r\nThere are a record high 493 newcomers to the list—roughly one new billionaire every 17 hours, including 210 from China and Hong Kong and 98 from the U.S. The richest newcomer, at $38.2 billion, is Miriam Adelson of Nevada, who inherited her husband Sheldon Adelson’s casino empire following his death in January. Other notable new entrants include movie and TV producer Tyler Perry, Bumble dating app cofounder Whitney Wolfe Herd—the world’s youngest self-made woman billionaire, and Europe’s Guillaume Pousaz, founder of payments firm Checkout.com. Another 250 people who’d fallen off the billionaires’ list in the past came roaring back. Altogether, a staggering 86% of all billionaires are richer than a year ago.\r\n\r\nJeff Bezos is the world’s richest person for the fourth year running, worth $177 billion, up $64 billion from a year ago as a result of surging Amazon shares. Elon Musk—the biggest gainer in dollar terms—rocketed into the No. 2 spot with a $151 billion fortune, a whopping $126.4 billion more than a year ago, when he ranked No. 31 and was worth $24.6 billion. The main reason: a 705% climb in Tesla shares. French luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault holds onto his spot at No. 3 but his fortune nearly doubled to $150 billion, from $76 billion, due to an 86% rise in the shares of LVMH, owner of brands including Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior and cosmetics retailer Sephora. The top ten richest are worth $1.15 trillion, up by two-thirds from $686 billion last year. Altogether, Europe’s billionaires are $1 trillion richer than a year ago.\r\n\r\nThis year there are four people worth $100 billion or more—up from just one (Bezos) on last year’s list. Besides Bezos, Musk and Arnault, there’s Bill Gates, who ranks No. 4 at $124 billion, buoyed by the strength of shares he owns in Microsoft, Canadian National Railway and tractor maker Deere & Company.",

		"post_content": "SEATTLE — Seattle is one of four cities participating in a new trial of an investigational COVID-19 vaccine that was developed by Moderna to protect people against a coronavirus variant first detected in South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Phase 1 clinical trial, taking place at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI), is testing the immune response generated by the new vaccine candidate, as well as safety. The trial will not determine whether the vaccine prevents infection by the variant or stops its spread in the population, according to KPWHRI.\r\n\r\nThe B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant first identified in the Republic of South Africa has been detected in at least nine states. As of April 1, at least 17 cases have been reported in Washington, according to the state Department of Health.\r\n\r\nThe first doses of the new vaccine were administered at KPWHRI April 1-3. Moderna’s new vaccine candidate includes “aspects of the variant that was first seen in South Africa,” which differs from the company’s vaccine already approved for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\r\n\r\nRELATED: Moderna has created COVID vaccine to battle South African variant\r\n\r\n“In a remarkably short period of time, scientists at Moderna and (the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) have created a new vaccine based on their previous vaccine, which is now being given to millions of people worldwide,” said Dr. Lisa A. Jackson, a KPWHRI senior investigator who is overseeing the trial.\r\n\r\nResearchers aim to enroll approximately 210 healthy adult volunteers, including adults who’ve already received the original Moderna vaccine, as well as adults who have not.\r\n\r\n“If it turns out that we ultimately do need an updated vaccine that's more specifically targeted toward this variant, then the fact that we're getting started on these studies right now means that the evaluation will be underway, [and] we will hopefully have a candidate vaccine kind of in the pipeline,\" explained Dr. John Dunn of KPWHRI. \"If it turns out that we need it, we'll be able to get it up [and] ready.\"",
